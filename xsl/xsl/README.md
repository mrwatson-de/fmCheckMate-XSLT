# About the xsl/xsl Folder

These XSLTs can be applied to xslt files.

(Wait up, I think my head is going to ðŸ¤¯!)

The `*_ListXpaths*` XSLTs are particularly useful for analysing the structure of xml files.

The `xsl_xsl_CreateStandaloneStylesheet.xsl` File can be used to create a standalone XSLT (Gee, did I write that? and does it work?!)

The `xsl_html_ParameterInputForm.xsl` file is a starting attempt at an xslt which fmCheckMate could use to create a dynamic input form, so that it could support parameters for its XSLTs ... 

ðŸ¤¯ BOOM!
