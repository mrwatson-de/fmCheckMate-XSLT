# About the xsl/fmxmlsnippet Folder

The XSLTs in this folder can be applied to the FileMaker clipboard.


## Filenames

The XSLT files follow the following naming convention:

`<source-type>_<target-type.subtype>_<NameInCamelCase>.xsl`

For example:

`XMFD_Text.Lines_ListFieldNamesAndIDs.xsl` - accepts copied fields (or tables or even layouts/valuelists) and returns a list of field names and ids, one line per field.



## ðŸ“‹ Source-types 

The main source-types are:

- `XMAA` - FileMaker All/Any XML
- `XMFD` - FileMaker Field XML
- `XMFN` - FileMaker (Custom) Function XML
- `XML2` - FileMaker Layout XML Version 2 (FM12+)
- `XMLO` - FileMaker Layout XML Version 1 (FM11-)
- `XMME` - FileMaker Custom Menu XML (*)
- `XMMI` - FileMaker Custom Menu Item XML (*)
- `XMMR` - FileMaker Custom Menu References XML (*)
- `XMMS` - FileMaker Custom Menu Sets XML (*)
- `XMSC` - FileMaker Script XML
- `XMSS` - FileMaker Script Step XML
- `XMTB` - FileMaker Table XML
- `XMTH` - FileMaker Theme XML
- `XMVL` - FileMaker ValueList XML

 (*) Note: The abbreviations for Custom Menus `XMM*` are still a bit experimental (because they actually use the FMObjectTransfer XML internally, and at the original time of implementation were not yet fully ripe)


## ðŸŽ¯ Target-types

The target-types are:

- all the source types except `XMAA`
- `fmCM`- output for fmCheckmate (for LayoutAnalysis results)
- `FMPXMLRESULT` - xml output for import into FileMaker
- `Text` - text output (muliple lines per item)
- `Text.Chart`- text output, that will be displayed in fmCheckmate as a chart
- `Text.Chart.Tops`- text output displayed in fmCheckmate as a 'top 10' chart
- `Text.Chart.Trafficlight`- text output
displayed in fmCheckmate as a trafficlight chart
- `Text.Lines` - line-oriented text output (generally 1 line per item)
- `Text.HTML` - HTML output
- `Text.Stats` - 
- `Text.SVG` - output as [scalable vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)
- `Text.Tab` - tab delimited table output.
  - If line 2 is a single '-', fmCheckMate renders this as an HTML table.
- `Text.tgf` - [trivial graph format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Graph_Format) output
- `Text.xml` - xml output
- `Text.xml.graphml` - graphml output. fmCheckMate exports and opens this format.
- `XMDF` - FileMaker XML Default Fields format (FM19+)
- `XMDI` - FileMaker XML Default Items format (FM18-)
- `XSLT` - xslt file

Note the subtle diffence between a `Text` target and a `Text.Lines` target:

- `XMFD_Text_PrintFieldDefinitions.xsl` - prints field definitions, as they appear in the calculation editor over multiple lines
- `XMFD_Text.Lines_ListFieldDefinitions.xsl` - outputs field definitions one field on a single line
  - This is used when performing a basic diff on files

## Applicability of Source-types

Note that although a source-type identifies the *main* object type that a file aims to transform it is not necessarily the *only* type of object that may work. Often the parent object-type also works.

For example:

- many of the `XMSS` script step transformations also work on scripts - or even Layout objects!
- similarly `XMFD` field transformations mostly work on copied tables.

on the other hand, it tends to not be the case the other way round

- `XMSC` transformations which operate on entire scripts tendc not to make seneÂ´se when applied to script steps alone.

Similarly you may be able to extract field information from a layout using an `XMFD`transformation.

## Analyse, Change, Transform

fmCheckMate categorises the XSLT transformations into three broad categories:

- Analyse = Transformations with a Text output
- Change = Transformations with the same output type as input type
- Transform = Transformations with a different output type as input type
