#About the bin folder

**Note: The bin folder is NOT the rubbish bin or waste paper basket! Do NOT delete its contents!**

The bin folder contains various commands: bash shell commands, apple scripts, awk scripts and (potentially) other binary executables. (Thus the name bin)

The files here are used by some of the TextMate commands in the fmCheckMate TextMate Bundle.

If you use TextMate please contact MrWatson to find out more about the fmCheckMate TextMate Bundle

...and - if you know how - please do add more of your own powerful commands here - And tell me about them!
