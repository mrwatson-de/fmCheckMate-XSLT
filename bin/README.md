# About the bin folder

**Note: The bin folder is NOT the rubbish bin or waste paper basket! Do NOT delete its contents!**

The bin folder contains various commands: bash shell commands, apple scripts, awk scripts and (potentially) other binary executables. (Thus the name bin)

- `text_XMSS_ConvertFmPseudoCodeToScriptSteps` - an AWK script to convert FileMaker pseudo-code to **real** FileMaker script steps

- `fmxmlsnippet_*` - files used by some of the TextMate commands in the fmCheckMate TextMate Bundle.
  - If you use TextMate please contact MrWatson to find out more about the fmCheckMate TextMate Bundle
  - ...and - if you know how - please do add more of your own powerful commands here - And tell me about them!
